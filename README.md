AadharPanMatcher

AadharPanMatcher is a Java-based application that matches and validates Aadhar and PAN card details using object-oriented programming principles and the Java Collection Framework. This project demonstrates the efficient handling of large datasets through the use of OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, alongside Java's collection data structures.

Features

Aadhar-PAN Matching: Compare Aadhar and PAN details to identify matches and mismatches.
Validation Mechanism: Ensure the integrity and format of both Aadhar and PAN details.
Efficient Data Storage: Utilize Java collections such as HashMaps and Lists to store and retrieve large datasets effectively.
OOP Design: Organized into modules that follow OOP principles for maintainable and extensible code.
Technologies

Java: Core programming language.
Collection Frameworks: Utilized to handle and manipulate large datasets (HashMap, List, etc.).
OOP Concepts: Implemented through classes, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance for code modularity and efficiency.
Usage

To run the application:

Clone the repository.
Compile and run the AadharPanMatcher.java file.
Input Aadhar and PAN details for matching and validation.
Installation
